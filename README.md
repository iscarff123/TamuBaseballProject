# TAMU Baseball Project
### Time of Project: Fall 2018
### Independent Study Project
### Bachelors of Science in Statistics, Texas A&M University

For this project, I analyzed data from the Texas A&M baseball team and developed a tool for in-game predictions. I created an algorithm, along side a multi-nomial logistic regression model, to predict what type of pitch a pitcher might throw next. While I am providing my code, I will not be providing the original game data because it is unknown to me whether or not I can share it publicly. It is also unknown to me if other independent parts of this project were completed, or if Texas A&M uses any such tool currently. For more details about this project, please see the [Pitcher Model Presentation](https://github.com/iscarff123/TamuBaseballProject/raw/main/Pitcher%20Model%20Presentation.pptx) and [Baseball Project Final Report](https://github.com/iscarff123/TamuBaseballProject/blob/main/Baseball%20Project%20Final%20Report.pdf) files.
